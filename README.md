# Human-Activity-Recognition-

### Introduction:

Human activity recognition (HAR) is a well-known research topic, that involves
the correct identification of different activities, sampled in a number of ways. In
particular, sensor-based HAR makes use of inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, to sample acceleration and angular velocity of a body.
Sensor-based techniques are generally considered superior when compared with
other methods, such as vision-based, which use cameras and microphones to
record the movements of a body.

### About Data

These data has been provided from sensors which is inertial sensors talked in introduction part. There in total 6 categories.

1: 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS'<br/>
2: 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS'<br/>
3: 'SITTING'<br/>
4: 'STANDING'<br/>
5: 'LAYING'<br/>
6: 'WALKING'<br/>
